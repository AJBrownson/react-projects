## Overview

- A quick React mini-project to quickly grasp the finer points of the programming language.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.


## My process

- Project Start Date: Friday 14th January, 2022
- Project Completion Date: Tuesday 18th January, 2022
-  - On account of PC issues, this couldn't be completed over the weekend as was intended.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I learnt the basics of React like creating components, styling them and finally importing them to be rendered to the DOM.


### Continued development

- This was great but I gotta work on getting better with coding in React.


### Useful resources

- [React Navbar Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL8cFqhTHwA) - This is an amazing video tutorial which helped me grab the basics of ReactJS. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to learn the programming language alongside building something at the same time.
